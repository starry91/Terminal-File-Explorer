1) For Command mode: Once it switches to canon mode, read each char and keep on putting them in buffer until either "\n" or ESC occurs, based on which you can pass to the command or return to Normal mode

Create class(contains func calls for each command) for command mode operations 
Copy.Move/Rename: Check perms to copy
2) Copy: 
	Parse statement, copy(open, write) each file in a loop to the mentioned dir (*dont forget to convert to abs path)

3) Move:
	Similar to copy, expect delete from the main location after it

4) Rename:
	Similar to move, but the copied file will be in the same location
